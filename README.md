# Corporate Connections Analysis Project

This project uses data from the  Receita Federal's CNPJ registry to connect companies located in Brazil that share common partners. In this network, companies are represented as vertices, and the common partners form the edges. The primary objective is to analyze business relationships, providing insights into corporate connections and aiding in the identification of potential prospects.
